title: A month with Mac
---
I was planning for a long time to make the switch from Windows-based PC to Mac. I love Apple laptops and computers, but in contrast with that, I kind of hate all its mobile devices (yes, including iPad mini!).

The main reason behind this hatred is the iOS software, which is  starting to spread in the Mac OS X. But more of that later.

So, I bought my Macbook Air almost a month ago and I'll never regret it. It's the best computer I've ever had, although it has nearly the specs of my desktop, which runs on a 6-core CPU backed with 8gigs of RAM. The Macbook Air has a relatively slow and underpowered CPU, an Intel i5 Ivy Bridge but it's more than enough for any kind of work.

On a typical day, I'm running Photoshop, Firefox, Sublime Text 2 , Codekit and all the Mac programs plus my terminal and sometimes Illustrator. The laptop never slows me down and it's always cool to the touch.

And also, it looks gorgeous!

But as I said before, there are some problems with the software.  Apple is currently left behind in this field. I'm talking about UI and UX issues. Most apps feel a little weird and also, the skeuomorphism used in the UI design is horrible. Apple has to learn some great lessons on that from Microsoft. In my opinion, Windows 8 is the best thing happened for UX design since a long time. It's just feel nice and natural without pretending to be something it's not.

All in all, I'm in love with my new laptop and I would gladly recommend it. But just don't buy it for surfing the internet and watch kitten videos on Youtube. Buy a cheap laptop and install Ubuntu on it.
