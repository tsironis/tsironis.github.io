### The quick (but mandatory intro)

Hello world! This is the first blog post on this super-hipster blog.

This blog which isn't really a blog but more like static pages put together (1995 style, motherflippers!). It's using the awesome blog-aware static page generator, Jekyll which is the engine behind Github Pages. 

In the beginning, it was a little hard to adapt from the comfort of the ready-to-use Wordpress platform. But I managed to get it up and running, write the markup and the CSS required in just 3-4 hours.

After that, some details need to be added in the future but nothing too important.

This weblog is all about simplicity and the power of raw HTML. No fancy databases and back-end, just markdown and some CSS.

And Git magic!
