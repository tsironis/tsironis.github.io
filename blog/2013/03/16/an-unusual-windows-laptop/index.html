		<h2>A little bit of history</h2>

<p>Almost a year ago, I was searching about my new laptop, which eventually <a href="http://dtsironis.net/posts/a-month-with-mac/">came to be Macbook Air 13"</a>. It was a long search for the perfect and it turned out very well. I loved my Macbook Air from the first touch; it&rsquo;s light, built like a tank with so much power underneath. It never lets me down.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tsironakos/8562120770/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8236/8561014151_a836d13164_z.jpg" title="Dell XPS 13" alt="Dell XPS 13" /></a></p>

<p>But one of the candidates was then a new-comer. I think it had just hit the news and I was actually starring at the beautiful product page for hours. It was a piece of beauty, probably the best looking laptop ever made. It&rsquo;s the Dell XPS 13.</p>

<h2>Still one of the best</h2>

<p>Several days ago, I was asked for my opinion on a laptop. Of course, I started searching the web for the best laptop out there, I found some interesting laptops, but then I remembered the one and only XPS 13. I had seen it before in the Greece JS meetup and I was staring at it lustfully, feeling a bit ashamed of my Macbook Air.</p>

<h2>Unboxing</h2>

<p>When I unboxed it I was amazed by the high quality standards of the new dell packaging. I thought it would be one of this ugly recycled-paper boxes that used to ship computers in. But it&rsquo;s a beautiful black box with a nice feel and inside it, there was a case. The only purpose of the case was to contain the laptop itself. I tell you, it was awesome to open the case and find the laptop lying there, like a treasure in a chest.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tsironakos/8562120770/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8236/8561014151_a836d13164_z.jpg" title="Dell XPS 13" alt="Dell XPS 13 keyboard" /></a></p>

<p>The laptop itself is very solid build quality and it has an awesome backlit chiclet keyboard.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>The only problem is that it shipped with Windows 7 which seems a little outdated to me, since Windows 8 is on the market for quite some time now. Also, I&rsquo;m allergic to the usual crapware that OEMs pack with their Windows installations. They&rsquo;re hideous, useless piece of software that insult the rest of software.</p>

<p>All-in-all, if you want a great Linux or Windows laptop that looks astonishing and behaves like a proper machine, then I think Dell XPS 13 is a no-brainer for you.</p>
