    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Few months ago, I have written a prototype of a library to use <code>localStorage</code> more efficiently. In the meantime, I totally forgot about it until I started writing the v2.0.0 of the <a href="https://github.com/bugsense/bugsense.js">BugSense JavaScript SDK</a>.</p>

beast that nobody really understands, a language so wicked that noone really
wants to write it anyway, although it&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Kindles for almost two years. My first Kindle was a 4th generation Kindle (not the touch one). Since then, ebooks for me was just a thing from a science fiction articles, just like flying cars. It was technically plausible but couldn&rsquo;t see it replacing paper books anytime soon. News flash, I was wrong. So when the new Kindle Paperwhite came out a few months ago, I decided to upgrade my Kindle to a new Kindle Paperwhite. I did long the touchscreen which makes everything so much easier and I ordered it from Amazon.</p>

<p>In my previous post, I wrote about my experience <a href="http://dtsironis.net/posts/how-to-vim/">switching to Vim</a>. After getting familiar with using Vim, I started to search on ways to improve my workflow. At the time, I was using Janus build and I have to say, I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it too much. So I had two choices; the first was to start off and build my own Vim configuration from the ground up and the second was to find a &ldquo;pret-a-porter&rdquo; solution. I chose the latter and head to Github to start the quest of finding the perfect Vim configuration. I had already excluded Janus because way too complicated to mess around with and it&rsquo;s pretty heavy as well. Then, I remembered about <a href="https://github.com/fatih/subvim/">Subvim</a> which is a great effort to emulate Sublime Text 2 in a Vim environment. That didn&rsquo;t suit me as well, found it to be heavy and just not my taste.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I grew up in a fairly technical family; my parents have both programming background. Heck! my mother programs in <code>vi</code> until this day and I was always aware of this obscure thing, called Vim. But three years ago, when I decided it was time to move from the (then popular) Notepad++, I came across Sublime Text 2. At the time, it was still in beta version, but it was apparent to me that it was a completely different experience than the old Notepad++. The vast choice of plugins, the dark theme, the performance of the whole application was a no-brainer for me. I fell in love with it at first sight, I adopted it as my default editor and it served me well for almost three years across Windows, Linux &amp; Mac.</p>

while to understand what exactly is Mercurial&rsquo;s philosophy and adapt my
workflow to the new system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is one of these endless battles in the history of humanity.  Open-source vs. proprietary software; is one of the most vibrant disputes of all time. I tell you, it&rsquo;s not an easy one and being a part of tech community, you feel obligated to choose a side from early on, as everyone is taking a stand on this subject (though it&rsquo;s not required after all).</p>

<p>Many of my friends, being developers like me, have trouble when it comes down to design some basic stuff and that&rsquo;s completely normal. Developers, although they create beautiful &amp; elegant stuff, they don&rsquo;t particularly like drawing lines and colours to compose something.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Sexism, tech conferences &amp; Twitter hatred</h3>

<p>Few days ago, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/a-dongle-joke-that-spiraled-way-out-of-control/">a bad situation</a> happened at PyCon. Reportedly, some developers were making some forking jokes and Adria Richards, a (ex) Sendgrid-employed developer evangelist was offended by these jokes. She talked about feminism and stuff like that.</p>

<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t understand how that sexual joke is specifically addressed in women. Last time I checked, sexual intercourse didn&rsquo;t require <em>exclusively</em> women to be a thing. So, I guess this may be as insulting for a guy as it is for a girl. In my point of view, that&rsquo;s the whole point of feminism. We&rsquo;re equal. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s just favouritism.</p>

<p>Ok, I get it. Tech industry is dominated by males. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we are more sexist than males in other industries. Personally, I have no problem accepting that a woman can kick my ass in any of my skills. And I know for sure that many women actually exactly that.</p>

<p>But the main point I want to make is that it&rsquo;s just a mother-flipping joke. There&rsquo;s something more important than the urge to politically correct every single conference, TV show, work environment etc. It&rsquo;s called humour and knowing when to chillax and just enjoy yourself.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VWFCB.png" alt="Hardcore Forking action" /></p>

<p>And as a matter of facts, the &ldquo;fork you&rdquo; joke is pretty common. Github made a bold move and implemented it in the user interface, when you&rsquo;re forking a repo.</p>

<p>Why do we tend to overcomplicate things?</p>

<p>Almost a year ago, I was searching about my new laptop, which eventually <a href="http://dtsironis.net/posts/a-month-with-mac/">came to be Macbook Air 13"</a>. It was a long search for the perfect and it turned out very well. I loved my Macbook Air from the first touch; it&rsquo;s light, built like a tank with so much power underneath. It never lets me down.</p>

<p>Few months ago, I started following <a href="http://zachholman.com/">@holman</a> on Github and Twitter. He&rsquo;s doing a great job on Github and on open-source projects and he&rsquo;s creating some very interesting video and screencasts.</p>

<p>One of the videos was about Play, a music manager by Github and how they can play their music from the Campfire chat rooms using Hubot, which is a very cool little robot written in Node.js.</p>

<p>At the time, I was thinking it would be cool to deploy my own Hubot but I didn&rsquo;t find any cause for doing such (except being a geek). So, when I started Geembo last month or so, I started thinking of using Hubot to have some fun but also, to automate some of our everyday tasks.</p>

<p>So, Geembot was born today, after few hours of screwing around its source code. The initial plan was that it would be deployed on Heroku, but soon enough we found out that Heroku and Node.js or perhaps hubot don&rsquo;t match very well together.</p>

<p>So, I fired up a fresh Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS VM and deployed Geembot.</p>

<p>I can tell you, it&rsquo;s not easy to deploy a hubot. But if you&rsquo;re an advanced system administrator, I think you would success soon enough.</p>

<p>Geembot is very cool, fast and very extensible. The scripts already written for hubot are literally hundreds and we have to search what we gonna do with him.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>The quick (but mandatory intro)</h3>

<p>Hello world! This is the first blog post on this super-hipster blog.</p>

<p>This blog which isn&rsquo;t really a blog but more like static pages put together (1995 style, motherflippers!). It&rsquo;s using the awesome blog-aware static page generator, Jekyll which is the engine behind Github Pages.</p>

<p>In the beginning, it was a little hard to adapt from the comfort of the ready-to-use Wordpress platform. But I managed to get it up and running, write the markup and the CSS required in just 3-4 hours.</p>

<p>After that, some details need to be added in the future but nothing too important.</p>

<p>This weblog is all about simplicity and the power of raw HTML. No fancy databases and back-end, just markdown and some CSS.</p>

<p>And Git magic!</p>
