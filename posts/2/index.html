				Lockr v0.5.0 Released</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>Few months ago, I have written a prototype of a library to use <code>localStorage</code> more efficiently. In the meantime, I totally forgot about it until I started writing the v2.0.0 of the <a href="https://github.com/bugsense/bugsense.js">BugSense JavaScript SDK</a>.</p>

<p>So I started development for bugsense.js and I run into the same issues using the native <code>localStorage</code> API. I needed something modular, lightweight and with a very small bytesize.</p>

<p>And then it came to me. I had already written most of the library, although it needed some work to be combat-ready.</p>

<p>Eventually, I designed the API wrapper very much influenced by the <a href="https://github.com/mranney/node_redis/">node_redis</a> client. I wrote some specs for it, make sure everything is working as it should and here it is.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a very early version, but I do want to keep it that simple in the future, maybe with some extra features.</p>

<p>I would love your feedback to make it more awesome and to have more stuff in v1.0.0. Give it <a href="https://github.com/tsironis/lockr/star">some love</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tsironis/lockr/fork">fork it</a> to make it better!</p>

				Enjoyable Javascript</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<h2>The first handshake</h2>

<p>When I started learning the building elements of the Web, I had the impression that Javascript is that hefty, untamable
beast that nobody really understands, a language so wicked that noone really
wants to write it anyway, although it&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get this out of the way. Javascript is not an inherently bad language. Its notoriety
originates mainly on some crappy browser and DOM APIs, bad implementations of specs
and the general ambiguity that reigns in the Browser Vendors Land. Yes, it is a
stil very immature language but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not powerful enough.</p>

<h2>Getting more intimate</h2>

<p>For people that aren&rsquo;t very familiar with it, writing Javascript is just a matter of registering some jQuery events which control animations. Writing webapps in Javascript puts you in a completely different state in which you <strong>need</strong> to write modular, maintanable and testable code. You have to organize your code efficiently in order to avoid having a &ldquo;spaghetti code&rdquo; codebase.</p>

<p>When I joined <a href="http://bugsense.com/">BugSense</a>, I immediately started to put all of the above principles in
practice. Backbone.js isn&rsquo;t opinionated enough to force me to structure or code in some particular
pattern, so I was starting anew. Coming from a more opinionated background, in which
I had a basic code structure already layed out, I was kinda freaked out.</p>

<p>It turns out that taking key decisions about my project on my own is one of the best things that I
learned while writing Javascript.</p>

<h2>Javascript is flexible</h2>

<p>One of the wow moments I had with Javascript, was the ability to easily do
evaluations, one-liners (almost LISPy things) without having to bleed through
my ears. Events, closures, functional js, being able to do this&hellip;</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="nx">X</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="nx">doSomething</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">doSomethingElse</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></div>


<p>&hellip;made me fall in love with it after a while.</p>

<h2>Building a decent workflow</h2>

<p>I think this point is true for every language. You should try moving things out
of your way, optimizing your everyday work, organizing your project&rsquo;s structure as well as possible and having repetitive tasks done automatically. It should be just you and the language, nothing more. Especially for Javascript you should try having multiple files and concatenating or minifying them with Grunt.</p>

<h2>Getting serious</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in a state that you want to take it to the next level, then I think you should try strict mode. Just put <code>use 'strict';</code> at the top of your js files. This have
will help you write more consistent code across implementations and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode">other
things</a>.</p>

<p>Most importantly, don&rsquo;t hate Javascript, but instead you can try to get the most out of it. All languages and tools have their limitations after all.</p>

<p>The question is could you rise to the occassion?</p>

				Is Kindle Paperwhite Really Worth It?</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Kindles for almost two years. My first Kindle was a 4th generation Kindle (not the touch one). Since then, ebooks for me was just a thing from a science fiction articles, just like flying cars. It was technically plausible but couldn&rsquo;t see it replacing paper books anytime soon. News flash, I was wrong. So when the new Kindle Paperwhite came out a few months ago, I decided to upgrade my Kindle to a new Kindle Paperwhite. I did long the touchscreen which makes everything so much easier and I ordered it from Amazon.</p>

<h2>First things first</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s been two months since it arrived. It is always surprising to see how minimal the packaging that Amazon chose for Kindle is. One thing that I noticed is that they didn&rsquo;t include a USB adapter, just the cable. I wasn&rsquo;t bummed because I never really used the USB adapter with my old Kindle. I boot it for the first time, logged in with my Amazon account and boom, everything was there.</p>

<h2>Screen got a lot better</h2>

<p>I contemplated that the great success of Kindle was the lack of illuminated screen. The look and feel of physical paper of my old Kindle was quite useful for well lit rooms, but it still had some glowing issues, especially when you read books on your bed with a single source of light. Kindle Paperwhite has a very dimable front-lit screen which is actually is perfect for every situation. You can read in a dark room without having your eyes being tortured, you can read on sunlight or in metro without any difficulty at all.</p>

<p>Screen resolution have increaded as well. With the previous Kindle I found myself prefering a larger font because resolution it wasn&rsquo;t that great. The Paperwhite is a huge improvement. Make no mistake though. It&rsquo;s not totally perfect but it doesn&rsquo;t get in your way which is good.</p>

<h2>Better hardware &amp; software</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s time for some geekiness! A faster processor which actually means it can render better images and you read comics better now. Also, it has an updated software which is nice, books appear with thumbnails if you want to and it offers a better Kindle Store experience as well.</p>

<p>Another feature that I use really often is &ldquo;Send to Kindle&rdquo;. There are some plugins for Firefox and Chrome that can format an web article in a small ebook and ship it over to your Kindle. It&rsquo;s almost a one-click process and then the article gets synced in your Kindle.</p>

<h2>Battery</h2>

<p>There is only one way to describe the battery life of Kindles. It is simple one of the most power efficient devices ever built. A nice change from modern electronic devices for sure. I charged it only once since I got it (no joke) and I have still more than 60% battery in my charge (I&rsquo;m using it every day since I got it). It is the kind of device that you&rsquo;re taking with half-charged battery over a long trip and you don&rsquo;t really notice. It&rsquo;s the device you should take on an enlighting 2-month trip to India without worrying about your battery life. It&rsquo;s the opposite of modern smartphones.</p>

<h2>Reading programming books</h2>

<p>As a result of increasing resolution, font rendering got a lot better. Reading programming books is very fluent although I still prefer having a printed book for this kind of subjects. It&rsquo;s easier to go back and forth, take notes etc. So yeah, although Kindle ebooks for programming are totally readable, it&rsquo;s not my favorite way of reading programming books. But some the Kindle editions of these books are a lot cheaper (also you don&rsquo;t pay the shipping fees).</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>The best thing about Paperwhite is that it made me read a whole lot more. I read every day while commuting to work or relaxing at home. I throw it in my backpack and I&rsquo;m ready to go and I don&rsquo;t need to worry about recharging or updating content that often. Hell! I use it more than my smartphone in an everyday basis.</p>

<p>Kindle is invaluable for me. It is the perfecy bond of technology and literature, the easiest way to read a book, it has a great battery life and doesn&rsquo;t get in your way. You can buy a book wherever you are and start reading it few moments later. I don&rsquo;t think it gets better than that.</p>

<p>It really is the best device money can by. Period.</p>

<p>Edit: HN discussion that the Paperwhite is indeed a front-lit screen, not a back-lit one. Corrections were made.</p>
